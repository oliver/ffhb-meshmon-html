Uploads the reported results from one Gatemon client to InfluxDB.
InfluxDB is accessed using its HTTP POST API and the InfluxDB Line Protocol.

@param $report The parsed results reported by a single Gatemon.
  Must be an array with the following entries:
  - name: string
  - uuid: string
  - provider: string
  - vpn-servers: array, each entry consisting of:
    - name: string
    - addresses: array with single entry:
      - entry 0 must be an array with two entries:
        - ipv4: integer (0 or 1)
        - ipv6: integer (0 or 1)
    - dns: same format as "addresses"
    - ntp: same format as "addresses"
    - uplink: same format as "addresses"

@param $influxConfig Configuration settings for connecting to InfluxDB.
  Must be an array with the following keys:
  - enabled: boolean value indicating whether data should be uploaded to InfluxDB at all
  - url: URL of the InfluxDB's "write" endpoint
  - username: user name to access InfluxDB
  - username: password to access InfluxDB
  - timeout: timeout in seconds for the HTTP POST request
